# PassVault-V1

For people who can't figure out how to use it, a video tutorial is coming soon!
(although I must say, I tried to make it as self explanatory as I could)

If you have any suggestions or are having trouble, just open a new issue!

One more request. If anyone can download this, convert it into an apk file for mobile compatibility, post it on Github, and open a new issue and put the link there along with the information needed to add you as a contributor, I'd be happy to add you as one.(Unless it's possible to add yourself on your own)

Thank you!
